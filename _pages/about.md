I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Bremen. I work at the [Institute for Analysis and Numerics](https://www.uni-muenster.de/AMM/en/index.shtml) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Marlies Pirner](https://www.uni-muenster.de/AMM/en/Pirner/index.shtml).

Beforehand, I did my PhD (Dr. rer. nat. in Mathematics) at the University of Bremen (supervised by Prof. Dr. Jens Rademacher and Prof. Dr. Marc Keßeböhmer).
