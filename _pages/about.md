Since June 2023, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute for Analysis and Numerics](https://www.uni-muenster.de/AMM/en/index.shtml) of the University of Münster. My supervisor is [Prof. M. Pirner](https://www.uni-muenster.de/AMM/en/Pirner/index.shtml).

Beforehand, I did my PhD (Dr. rer. nat. in Mathematics) at the University of Bremen, see [MGP](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=277103).

Temporarily, I worked at Jacobs University Bremen as a lecturer in mathematics.

I also worked in industry before returning to the academic world.
