I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Analysis and Numerics of the University of Münster in Germany. My supervisor is Prof. Dr. Marlies Pirner.

Before, I did my PhD (Dr. rer. nat. in Mathematics) at the University of Bremen under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Jens Rademacher and Prof. Dr. Marc Keßeböhmer.

Meanwhile, I worked as a lecturer and in industry.
