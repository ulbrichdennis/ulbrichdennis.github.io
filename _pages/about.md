<p style="color:red">Looking for a postdoc position in Mathematics or related areas!</p>
Until May 31, 2024, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute for Analysis and Numerics](https://www.uni-muenster.de/AMM/en/index.shtml) of the University of Münster. My supervisor is [Prof. Dr. M. Pirner](https://www.uni-muenster.de/AMM/en/Pirner/index.shtml).

Before, I did my PhD (Dr. rer. nat. in Mathematics) at the University of Bremen, see [MGP](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=277103).

Meanwhile, I worked as a lecturer for undergraduates and also in industry.
