## NEW: Open to job offers!

I am currently looking for a position as a postdoc or research assistant in mathematics. Please contact me if you have a position available or would like to get more details. Any suggestions are highly appreciated.

## About me

Until June 2024, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute for Analysis and Numerics](https://www.uni-muenster.de/AMM/en/institute.shtml) at the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/); I was supervised by [Prof. Marlies Pirner](https://www.uni-muenster.de/AMM/en/Pirner/index.shtml). 
  
I earned my PhD degree in Mathematics (*Dr. rer. nat.* in Mathematics) at the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Jens Rademacher](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/en/forschung/bereiche/am/ang-dynamische-systeme/personen/rademacher-jens.html) and [Prof. Marc Keßeböhmer](https://www.uni-bremen.de/dynsys/members/prof-dr-marc-kesseboehmer), cf. [MGP](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=277103).
