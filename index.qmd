## About me

I am interested in different topics in pure and applied mathematics, including analysis, ergodic theory and dynamical systems.

Most recently, I worked as a lecturer and research assistant at the Hochschule Bremen.

From 2023-2024, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Analysis and Numerics of the University of Münster where I was supervised by Prof. Marlies Pirner.

I obtained my PhD (Dr. rer. nat. in Mathematics) at the University of Bremen under the supervison of Prof. J. Rademacher and Prof. M. Keßeböhmer.

Moreoever, I did some teaching at the Jacobs University Bremen.

Further details can be found on the subpages above.
