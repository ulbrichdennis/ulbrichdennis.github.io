## About me

In the winter semester 2024/2025, I worked as a lecturer at the [School of Nature and Engineering](https://www.hs-bremen.de/en/hsb/faculties/school-of-nature-and-engineering/) of the [Hochschule Bremen](https://www.hs-bremen.de/en/).

Beforehand, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute for Analysis and Numerics](https://www.uni-muenster.de/AMM/en/institute.shtml) of the [University of MÃ¼nster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/).

I earned my PhD (*Dr. rer. nat.* in Mathematics) at the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/).
