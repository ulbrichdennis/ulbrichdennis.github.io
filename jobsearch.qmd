I am currently looking for a job in one of the following categories:

- Scientific employee in Mathematics or a related field, e.g.,  
  - Postdoctoral Researcher
  - Postdoctoral Research Fellow
- Lecturer in Mathematics
- Education worker, teacher
- Study organization, study advice 

I would be happy to receive suitable offers or other suggestions that do not readily fit into the categories above (and that I may not have thought of yet).

In any case, please feel free to send me an [Email](mailto:ulbrich@magenta.de). I am looking forward to your message!
